# Qlik Sense REST SDK #
This is a basic SDK for Qlik Sense REST access with authentication configuration built along the same line as the .Net SDK for the Engine API. Basic usage for accessing the "/qrs/about" endpoint could look like this:

```
var restClient = new RestClient(senseServerUrl);
restClient.AsNtlmUserViaProxy();
Console.WriteLine(restClient.Get("/qrs/about"));
```
